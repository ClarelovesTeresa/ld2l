## About LD2L
This is a league for Herald 0 - Legend 5 (approximately "Normal Skill" and "High Skill" on Dotabuff) to play Dota in a competitive-style setting without pressure from 5k+ players as may be common in RD2L or other leagues. The goal is to learn about playing Dota in general and about playing in a competitive team-based setting. External coaching, review, and education based on the games is encouraged.
