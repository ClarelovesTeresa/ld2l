# Learn Dota 2 League Rules

This is a league for Herald 0 - Legend 3 (approximately "Normal Skill" and "High Skill" on Dotabuff) to play Dota in a competitive-style setting without pressure from 5k+ players as may be common in RD2L or other leagues. The goal is to learn about playing Dota in general and about playing in a competitive team-based setting. External coaching, review, and education based on the games is encouraged.


## Draft Rules

1. Signups are handled via the league website using your Steam account.

2. In order to be draft-eligible or be added to the Free Agent or Standin lists, players must have a current badge of Legend 3 or below at the time of the draft (except those covered by the Graduation Rule), and their behavior must be vouched by a previous league participant. Vouching most commonly happens via inhouse games during the signup period.

3. Draft-eligibility for vouched players will be determined by signup date, on a first-come first-served basis. Remaining signups will compose the Free Agent pool.

4. Each team will have 6 fixed players consisting of a Captain and 5 drafted players. The Captain is responsible for all official communication with the admins and other Captains.

7. Draft order will be determined for each round by the average badge of the partially-drafted teams, lowest to highest.

8. For the purposes of the draft, all Heralds and Guardians will count toward draft order as if they were Crusader 0. 

9. Players who sign up and are vouched mid-season may be added to the Free Agent and Standin lists. Players may not join the Free Agent or Standin list during a season in which they were drafted. 


## Regular Season Rules

1. Regular season matches are played in a best-of-2 (bo2) format on Sundays at 5 PM Eastern on the USEast server.

2. Matches may be played on another server if both captains agree. If no other agreement is reached, the match should be played on the default server. Alternate server matches must be confirmed to the League Admins by both Captains via Discord.

3. Matches may be rescheduled if both captains agree. If no other agreement is reached, the default time is binding. Reschedules must be confirmed to the League Admins by both Captains via Discord.

4. Rescheduled matches may be completed earlier in the week of a scheduled match, or no later than 24 hours after the default time.

5. Regular season schedule will be posted via the website and Discord on the Monday following the Draft.

6. Each won game in a match is worth a point toward playoff seeding. Wins by forfeit count as wins for playoff qualifying purposes. Byes count for no points.



## Playoff Rules

1. Playoff matches are played in a best-of-3 (bo3) format on Sundays at 5 PM Eastern on the USEast server.

2. Reschedule/alternate server/result reporting rules are the same for the playoffs as for the regular season.

3. The single-elimination playoff bracket will be posted the Monday after the conclusion of the regular season.

4. Ties for playoff seeding will be settled first by head-to-head record, then by a bo1 tiebreaker match to be played during the week between the regular season and playoffs.



## Match Rules

1. Matches are expected to start on time. If a team does not have enough players at start time, they should request a standin from the available pool of the same badge tier or lower than the unavailable player. Players from other teams may not stand in.

2. Teams who opt to wait for a late player or who do not have their standin arranged on time will be given increasing draft penalties for the delayed game:
  |               |              |
  | :------------ | -----------: |
  | 5 minutes     | -30 seconds  |
  | 5-15 minutes  | -70 seconds  |
  | 15-25 minutes | -110 seconds |
  | 25+ minutes   | forfeit      |

  If it is the first game in the series, both games are forfeited

3. The winner of the in-game coin flip has choice of first pick, second pick, radiant, or dire.

4. The second game in the series is expected to start within 10 minutes of the conclusion of the first one. After that, draft penalties begin to apply as described above.

5. The loser of the first game has choice of first pick, second pick, radiant, or dire in the second game.

6. In the playoffs, should a third game be necessary, a new coin flip determines who has choice in the third game.

7. A team may not use more than one standin for each game. If a team only has 3 players present they must forfeit the game or series.

8. All-chat is permitted unless a captain requests no all-chat in the lobby or at the start of the match.

9. Bad manners, including but not limited to excessive flaming, harassment, racism, sexism, or other discrimination, are not permitted in or out of game, and punishment will be decided on a case by case basis ranging from individual warnings to being removed (even mid season).

10. Each team is permitted up to ten minutes of pause time (up to 20 total) for technical or connectivity issues. A pause may be initiated at any time outside of an ongoing teamfight, and a succinct explanation of the reason provided in all chat (regardless of all chat allowance). BM pauses, tactical pauses, etc. are not permitted and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

11. Resuming from a pause is permitted once both teams have acknowledged they are ready to continue. If the team that did not initiate the pause is not ready to continue, their pause time is used for the remaining duration.

12. If a team does not have pause time remaining, the match should be unpaused at that time. If pause is abused after time has expired to continue delaying the game, an admin will determine if a forfeit loss is to be awarded. If an admin is not in the lobby, the game should be played to conclusion (if possible) and will be reviewed afterwards.

13. If a player disconnects before first blood and cannot reconnect, the game can be remade with a fresh draft replacing the disconnected player. Suspected abuse of this rule will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

14. Match results must be reported on Discord in the \#results channel, including a screenshot of the score screen for each game in a series unless a forfeit was recorded. Results should be confirmed by both team captains.

15. Results, standings, and other administrative information will be maintained on Discord and the website.



## Broadcast and Spectating

1. Player experience is more important than broadcasters, streamers, or other observers. Captains are not required to consider caster availability when scheduling.

2. Spectators, including broadcast slots, are permitted at captain discretion for friends.

3. Teammates are always permitted to spectate in game by using a broadcast slot for games they are not playing in.

4. Teammates and friends may not communicate through any means during a game. If you suspect there is an issue with this contact an admin for further investigation.

5. "Official" or otherwise admin-sanctioned spectators are always permitted in broadcast slots unless it causes technical issues.

6. If an official streamer or broadcaster is assigned to a series, penalties will not be applied if they are late or the reason that a match is delayed. You must, however, wait for them unless instructed otherwise. Contact an admin if your game is experiencing delays due to official broadcasters.



## Team Rules

1. All players, if present, must be given the opportunity to play at least once in each series.

2. If a player leaves a team, they may be permanently replaced by a Free Agent of the same "draft tier" following discussion with the admins.

3. Disbands, kicking players, and leaving teams are strongly discouraged and may result in being unvouched or losing captain permissions for future seasons, depending on circumstances.

4. There are no player trades, swaps, or package deals.

5. Captains should submit a team name to admins and get it approved before the first week of matches.


## Graduation Rule

The stated goal of LD2L for players to improve. In an ideal world, every league player would eventually move on to higher MMR leagues because they would get too good to stay. So we don’t want to punish people for improving. So every league player is allowed one "Graduation Season". If a player climbs out of the badge range mid-season or between seasons, they are welcome to come back and play the following season as a one-time Graduation Exception to the badge limit. Graduation Exception players are highly encouraged to be Captains.

## Additional Advice for Captains

Captains are responsible for most of the league logistics and for making sure their team has a positive experience in the league. This means you’ll be scheduling scrims, finding standins if needed, and herding the players on your team. Some extra things you should do or keep in mind:

* Create a Discord server for your team with private voice chat for matches.

* Contact everyone on your team within a day of the draft sheet being posted, add them on steam, and invite them to your team Discord.

* Try to schedule at least one scrim per week if possible, and try to play pubs with your teammates to get to know one another.

* Be active on the league Discord. This is even more important than for regular players because a positive relationship helps to secure scrims and can help soften other captains who might want to rulebook you over minor issues.

* You may delegate any or all tasks but ultimately you are responsible for the team sticking together for a season. If your team disbands or players complain about your level of participation, you may lose the privilege of being a captain in future seasons.

* Create a team within the Dota client, and add your players to it. Use it for league matches. This game and team information will appear in your ESPORTS PROFILE on Dotabuff.

* Remember that while the league is competitive the objective is learning and practice. Also, remember the rule about playing all players if they are available: be mindful of players who may have conflicts come up for the first or second game in a series to ensure that they get to play!

* Seek advice from the coaches and replay analysts on the Discord server. We don’t have enough people to have individual coaches for each team, but the community will provide advice if you ask.
