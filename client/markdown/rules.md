# Learn Dota 2 League Rules

This is a league for Herald 0 - Archon 5 (approximately 0-3.2k MMR, commonly, “normal skill” on
dotabuff) to play dota in a competitive-style setting without pressure from 5k+ players as may be
common in RD2L or other leagues. The goal is to learn about playing dota in general and about
playing in a competitive team-based setting. External coaching, review, and education based on the
games is encouraged.
