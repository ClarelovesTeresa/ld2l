# Learn Dota 2 League Rules

This is a league for Herald 0 - Archon 5 (approximately 0-3.2k MMR, "Normal Skill" on Dotabuff) to play Dota in a competitive-style setting without pressure from 5k+ players as may be common in RD2L or other leagues. The goal is to learn about playing Dota in general and about playing in a competitive team-based setting. External coaching, review, and education based on the games is encouraged.

## General Season Rules

1. Signups end on January 12th, captains will be notified and confirmed on the 13th, and the draft will take place live on Discord and stream on the 14th.

2. Regular season games are played in a best-of-2 (bo2) format on Sundays at 5 PM EST, starting January 21

3. Matches may be rescheduled if both captains agree. If no other agreement is reached, the default time is binding.

4. The regular season will be 7 weeks long (January 21 - March 11) with play proceeding in a round robin fashion.

5. Playoff matches will be in a best-of-3 (bo3) format for the top four teams by wins over the regular season. Consolation playoff brackets for other teams are voluntary. Ties will be broken first by head-to-head result, and then a bo1 tiebreaker match.

6. Playoff games will be played on Sunday, March 18th and Sunday, March 25th at 5 PM EDT. If necessary, the tiebreaker for playoff spots will be played sometime before the first playoff date (by Captain and Admin arrangement).

7. Each team has 6 fixed players consisting of a Captain and 5 players drafted before the season. The Captain is responsible for all official communication with the admins and other Captains.

8. All players must have a current in-game badge of Archon 5 or below at the time of the draft (January 14) except those covered by the Graduation Rule.

9. Round robin schedule will be posted at the start of the season. The playoff bracket will be posted by the Monday after the regular season in order to give teams time to prepare.

10. Results, standings, and other administrative information will be maintained on Discord and the website.

## Match Rules

1. Matches are expected to start on time. If a team does not have enough players at start time, they should request a standin from the available pool of the same badge tier or lower than the unavailable player.

2. Teams who opt to wait for a late player or who do not have their standin arranged on time will be given increasing draft penalties for the delayed game:
    > 5 minutes, -30 seconds  
    > 5-15 minutes, -70 seconds  
    > 15-25 minutes, -110 seconds  
    > 25+ minutes, game is forfeited. If it is the first game in the series, both games are forfeited

3. The winner of the in-game coin flip has choice of first pick, second pick, radiant, or dire.

4. The second game in the series is expected to start within 10 minutes of the conclusion of the first one. After that, draft penalties begin to apply as described above.

5. The loser of the first game has choice of first pick, second pick, radiant, or dire in the second game.

6. In the playoffs, should a third game be necessary, a new coin flip determines who has choice in the third game.

7. A team may not use more than one standin for each game. If a team only has 3 players present they must forfeit the game or series.
All chat is permitted unless a captain requests no all chat in the lobby or at the start of the match.

8. Bad manners, including but not limited to excessive flaming, harassment, racism, sexism, or other discrimination, are not permitted in or out of game, and punishment will be decided on a case by case basis ranging from individual warnings to being removed (even mid season).

9. Each team is permitted up to ten minutes of pause time (up to 20 total) for technical or connectivity issues. A pause may be initiated at any time outside of an ongoing teamfight, and a succinct explanation of the reason provided in all chat (regardless of all chat allowance). BM pauses, tactical pauses, etc. are not permitted and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

10. Resuming from a pause is permitted once both teams have acknowledged they are ready to continue. If the team that did not initiate the pause is not ready to continue, their pause time is used for the remaining duration.

11. If a team does not have pause time remaining, the match may be unpaused at any time. If pause is abused after time has expired to continue delaying the game, an admin will determine if a forfeit loss is to be awarded. If an admin is not in the lobby, the game should be played to conclusion (if possible) and will be reviewed afterwards.

12. If a player disconnects before first blood and cannot reconnect, the game can be remade with a fresh draft replacing the disconnected player. Suspected abuse of this rule will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

13. Match results must be reported on Discord in the \#results channel, including a screenshot of the score screen for each game in a series unless a forfeit was recorded. Results should be confirmed by both team captains.

14. Each won game in a match is worth a point toward qualifying for the playoffs. Wins by forfeit count as wins for playoff qualifying purposes. Byes count for no points.

15. Replay files must be uploaded for matches played to https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6Dv_pNnNg88LWFnbkNkWDdJUjg, within 2 days of the series. Replays must include name of teams and game number in the series.

## Broadcast and Spectating

1. Player experience is more important than broadcasters, streamers, or other observers. Captains are not required to consider caster availability when scheduling.

2. Spectators, including broadcast slots, are permitted at captain discretion for friends.

3. Teammates are always permitted to spectate in game or use a broadcast slot for games they are not playing in.

4. Teammates and friends may not communicate through any means during a game. If you suspect there is an issue with this contact an admin for further investigation.

5. "Official" or otherwise admin-sanctioned spectators are always permitted in broadcast slots unless it causes technical issues.

6. If an official streamer or broadcaster is assigned to a series, penalties will not be applied if they are late or the reason that a match is delayed. You must, however, wait for them unless instructed otherwise. Contact an admin if your game is experiencing delays due to official broadcasters.

## Team Rules

1. All players, if present, must be given the opportunity to play at least once in each series.

2. If a player leaves a team, they may be permanently replaced by a Free Agent of the same "draft tier" following discussion with the admins.

3. Disbands, kicking players, and leaving teams are strongly discouraged and may result in being unvouched or losing captain permissions for future seasons, depending on circumstances.

4. There are no player trades, swaps, or package deals.
Captains should submit a team name to admins and get it approved before the first week of matches.

## Graduation Rule

The stated goal of LD2L for players to improve. In an ideal world, every league player would eventually move on to higher MMR leagues because they would get too good to stay. So we don’t want to punish people for improving. So every league player is allowed one "Graduation Season". If a player climbs out of the badge range mid-season or between seasons, they are welcome to come back and play the following season as a one-time Graduation Exception to the badge limit. Graduation Exception players are highly encouraged to be Captains.

## Additional Advice for Captains

Captains are responsible for most of the league logistics and for making sure their team has a positive experience in the league. This means you’ll be scheduling scrims, finding standins if needed, and herding the players on your team. Some extra things you should do or keep in mind:

* Create a Discord server for your team with private voice chat for matches.

* Contact everyone on your team within a day of the draft sheet being posted, add them on steam, and invite them to your team Discord.

* Try to schedule at least one scrim per week if possible, and try to play pubs with your teammates to get to know one another.

* Be active on the league Discord. This is even more important than for regular players because a positive relationship helps to secure scrims and can help soften other captains who might want to rulebook you over minor issues.

* You may delegate any or all tasks but ultimately you are responsible for the team sticking together for a season. If your team disbands or players complain about your level of participation, you may lose the privilege of being a captain in future seasons.

* Create a team within the Dota client, and add your players to it. Use it for league matches. This game and team information will appear in your ESPORTS PROFILE on Dotabuff.

* Remember that while the league is competitive the objective is learning and practice. Also, remember the rule about playing all players if they are available: be mindful of players who may have conflicts come up for the first or second game in a series to ensure that they get to play!

* Seek advice from the coaches and replay analysts on the Discord server. We don’t have enough people to have individual coaches for each team, but the community will provide advice if you ask.
